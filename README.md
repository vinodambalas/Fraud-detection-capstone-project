# Fraud-detection-capstone-project

Fraud Detection Project :
This project aims to identify fraudulent transactions within a dataset, leveraging machine learning to enhance fraud detection accuracy. Built using the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset, this analysis covers exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building for effective classification.

Project Highlights:
	•	Data Exploration: Comprehensive analysis of transaction types and patterns to identify key indicators of fraudulent activity.
	•	Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and normalized data to prepare for robust modeling.
	•	Modeling Techniques: Implemented multiple algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, evaluating model performance to identify the best classifier.
	•	Evaluation: Used metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC to assess model efficacy in detecting fraud.

Key Findings:

This project successfully identifies key features and patterns associated with fraud, achieving high accuracy and reliability in predictive modeling.
